===========================
What is Operating System ?
===========================

=> OS is a software

=> OS act as a mediator between users and computers

=> Wihout OS we can't use computers

=> We have several Operating Systems in the market

 Ex : Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris, Anroid, IOS
 
============ 
Windows OS  
============

=> Developed By Microsoft company

=> It is GUI based OS

=> It is licensed OS 

=> Single user based OS

=> Security features are less

Note: Anti Virus software we have to install.

=> Windows OS is recommended for personal use

Ex : watch movies, games, browsing, online classes

===========
Linux OS 
===========

=> Developed by Linus Torvalds

=> It is free and open source

=> Linux supports both GUI and CLI

=> Linux is multi user based OS

=> Linux is Virus free (security is very high)

=> It is highly recommended for business use cases

Ex : Database servers, app servers, k8s cluster, jenkins server, sonarqube server, docker server, nexus server, ELK, Log files...

====================
Linux Machine Setup
====================

Approach-1 : Install Linux OS directley in PC

Approach-2 : Install Linux as Guest OS using Virtual Box

Approach-3 : Setup Linux VM in windows using Vagrant

Approach-4 : Take linux vm for rent in cloud platform (AWS)


EC2 service we can use to setup virtual machines in aws cloud.

AWS Free Tier account (1 year)

EC2 : To setup virtual machines 

Monthly : 750 hours free of cost

===============
Lab Practicals
===============

Step-1 : Login into aws account 

Step-2 : Go to EC2 service and launch new instance 

		AMI : amazon linux 
		
		instance type : t2.micro / t3.micro
		
		Keypair : Create new keypair (.pem)
		
Step-3 : Select machine and click on Connect (SSH Client)

Step-4 : Open gitbash from keypair location and execute commands (chmod and ssh)

===================
Linux Architecture
===================

1) Apps / Commands

2) Shell

3) Kernel

4) Hardware components


=> Shell is responsible to validate command given by user and translate that into kernel understandable format.

=> Kernel is one of the core component in linux os. Kernel is responsible to give instructions to hardware to process command execution.

====================
Linux File System
=====================

=> In linux os everything will be represented as file only.

		/
		 /bin
		 /opt
		 /etc
		 /lib
		 /var
		 /mnt
		 /media
		 /home
		 
		 
Note: In Linux VM for every user one home directory will be available like below.

		 
	ec2-user : /home/ec2-user
	
	ashok   : /home/ashok
	
	sita : /home/sita

================	
Linux Commands 
================
toc
pwd: display present working directory.

cd<dir-name>:  To change directory 

cd .. -> To come out from directory in one step
cd ../.. ->To come out from directory in two steps

touch : create empty files 

ls : listing the data of pwd

ls -l : long listing with alphabetical order

ls -lr : display files in reverse of alphabetical

ls -lt : display latest files on top

ls -ltr : display old files on top

ls -la : show hidden files also

mkdir <dirname>: create new directory

rmdir <dirname>: remove empty directory

rm <filename> : remove file 

rm -r<filename> : remove non-empty directories(r-> it is recursive)
Note;remove content and directory
touch <filename>: to create empty files

cat : create file with data + append data + print data

		cat > abc.txt(create file with content)

		Note: after writing data press ctrl+d to save the data
		
		cat >> abc.txt(append data to existing file)
		
		cat abc.txt :To dispaly the file content
		
		cat -n abc.txt: to provide numbering(1,2,...)

		cat file1.txt > file2.txt: To copy one file data another file
tac : print data from bottom to top

cp  : copy one file to another file

mv <oldfilename> <new file name> : rename + move 
:To move one directory to another name

history : display user activities in linux

head : display first 10 lines of the file.

			head f1.txt :(It display by default frist 10 lines) 
			
			head -n 5 f1.txt :(It display frist 5 lines)
			
			head -n 100 f1.txt :(It display frist 100 lines)

tail : display last 10 lines of the file.

			tail f1.txt 
			
			tail -n 15 f1.txt :(It  will display last 15 lines)
			
			tail -n 50 app.log
			
			tail +n 20 f1.txt :(It will display  after 20 line to bottam)
			
			tail -f app.log
			wc <filename>: it used to print no.of.Lines,no of Words and no of Characters

=========================================
grep : global regular expression print..>(ctrl+f)
=========================================

=> It is used for searching data in the file

# print lines which contains ashokit keyword
grep 'ashokit' app.log

# print all files which countain that key word
grep 'ashok' *

# it will search pwd and sub dir also
grep -r 'ashok'

# print lines which contains ashokit keyword along with line numbers and ignore case sentivie

grep -n -i 'exception' app.log

# print lines which doesn't contains ashokit keyword

grep -v 'ashokit' app.log

# search for ashokit keyword in last 10 lines
tail app.log | grep 'ashokit'
 

# search for exception keyword in last 100 lines
tail -n 100 app.log | grep -n -i 'exception'


==========
vi editor (Visual Editor)
==========

=> It is used to edit the files in linux os

=> Using vi we can open existing files and we can create new files also.

$ vi java.txt

=> vi command works based on 3 modes

	1) command mode (read data)
	
	2) insert mode (press i in keyword)
	
	3) esc mode (press esc key)
	
	=> save and close (:wq + Enter)
	
	=> close without saving (:q! + Enter)

##############
sed command (Strem Editor)
##############
->sed stands for stream editor

->using sed command we can repalce the text with out opening file
# sed 's/linux/unix/' <file name> : just changes takes place but not saved(chnages will not reflect)

 #sed -i 's/linux/unix/' <file name> : changes take place and saved (changes will reflect)

-> Using this we can Delete the files with out opening file
sed '3d' <filename> : it will delate 3rd line in the file





	
=====================
Networking Commands
=====================

ifconfig : To check IP address of our machine

ping: To check connectivity

		ping www.google.com
		
		ping www.facebook.com 
		
		ping 172.31.4.278

wget: To download files from internet

	wget <url>
	

curl: To send Http request to server 

	curl https://reqres.in/api/users
	
================
User Management	
================

-> Linux OS is a multi user based OS

-> Multiple Users can connect with linux vm at a time.

Note: When we create linux vm using "Amazon Linux" AMI we will get 'ec2-user' as a default user with sudo priviliges.

SUDO : Super user doing operation


# check users available
cat /etc/passwd

# create new user 

Syntax : sudo useradd <username>

Ex : sudo useradd john

# set password for user 

Syntax : sudo passwd <username>

Ex : sudo passwd john

================================
What is sudoers file in linux ?
================================

Note: To give sudo priviliges for the users we need to add them in sudoers file.

# open sudoers file
sudo visudo

Note: Configure user like below (just below root user)

john    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
smith   ALL=(ALL)		ALL

Note: After adding user,  close that file using "CTRL + X + Y + Enter"

===================================================
How to enable password based authentication in linux ?
===================================================

=> In Linux VM by default PasswordAuthentication is disabled.

=> If we want to connect with Linux vm using  username and password we need to enable that.

# open sshd_config file
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

=> Find the Line containing â€˜PasswordAuthenticationâ€™ parameter and change its value from â€˜noâ€™ to â€˜yesâ€™

Note: save that file and close it using :wq + Enter

# restart sshd service 
sudo service sshd restart

# exit from the machine 
exit

# connect with linux vm usng john user 
# open gitbash 

# execute ssh command
ssh john@public-ip

==================
File Permissions 
==================

=> File permissions are divided into 3 types 

		a) read (r)
		b) write (w)
		c) execute (x)
		
=> File permissions will be represented like below

	Ex : -rwxrwxrwx f1.txt
	     drwxrwxrwx ashokit
	
=> First 3 characters will represent owner permissions (the user who created that file)

=> Middle 3 characters will represent group permissions.

=> Last 3 characters will represent other users permissions.	


Ex:

-rw-r-xr-x f1.txt 

owner => read + write 
group => read + execute 
others => read + execute 

-rwx------ f2.txt 

owner : read + write + execute 
group : Nothing
Others: Nothing

-r-xr-x--x
user :read+execute
group: read+ execute
others:execute

d-w---x---
user:write
group:execute
others:nothing



=> To add(+) or remove(-) file permissions we will use 'chmod' command.

# add execute permission for user(owner)
chmod u+x f1.txt 

# remove write permission for user(owner)
chmod u-w f1.txt 

# add write and execute permissions for group
chmod g+wx f1.txt

# remove read permission for others
chmod o-r f1.txt

=> We can represent file permissions using numeric numbers also.

0 => No Permissions 

1 => Execute

2 => Write

3 => (2+1) => Write + Execute 

4 => Read 

5 => (4+1) => Read + Execute 

6 => (4+2) => Read + Write 

7 => (4+2+1) => Read + Write + Execute

# user-read, group-write, others- r+e
chmod 425 f1.txt

# u+rw, g+w, o+we
chmod 623 f1.txt

#u-rwx, g-rwx , o+rwx
chmod 7 f1.txt 

#u-rwx, g+rwx , o+rwx
chmod 77 f1.txt 

======================================
How to change ownership of the file ?
======================================

=> using chown command we can change ownership 

$ sudo chown ashok f1.txt


==================
Package Managers
==================

Package : A software 

=> Package managers are used to manage softwares installation in linux machines.

=> Package Managers are specific to linux distribution.

yum : amazon linux, cent os
